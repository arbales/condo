## A thing for Convore

Right now, all Condo does it notify you of stuff. It'll grow, maybe. And, right now, its only for Mac. Sorry Linux pals.

### Using it
1. `brew install growlnotify` (libnotify is coming laterâ€¦)
2. `npm install -g condo` Install it globally so you can use the binary.
3. `CONVORE_USERNAME=jonforce CONVORE_PASSWORD=smithcloud condo`

### Contributing
1. `git clone arbales/condo`
2. `cd condo`
3. `npm install` does what bundler does, basically.
4. `./bin/condo.js` is the runner.
